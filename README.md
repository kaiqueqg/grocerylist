### Explanation

###### Why?

- I made this project because I was using Google Keep to help with my grocery list but it lack some features that would help me as a user e.g. :
  - Easy to use categories, not complicated like other apps and not easy to mess like pulling the item to the side(tab) like Keep.
  - On Keep, you need to get inside the setting to change the "move to bottom when checked". I needed a easy access button for that.
  - A "locking" mechanism to inhibit unwanted changes to the list when using the phone.

###### How?

- The tools and choices are not exactly to best for the job, but more of what I wanted to learn or practice. Some patterns or frameworks may be overkill, others may be unnecessary.
